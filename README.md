# Scradventure

Scradventure is a 2D action game with multiple levels and attack mode. This game was developed with the Godot game engine 
and written in GDScript.

The main objective of this game is to kill the 2 final bosses at the second stage. To do this, you first need to clear some of the enemies in stage 1. 
For every enemy you kill, you will get some XP and if your XP level reaches level 5, the portal located at the end of stage 1 will appear and you can teleport to level 2.
At level 2, there are two bosses who have higher attack speed, damage, and health. Besides, they will also spawn the enemies for every certain amount of time, so try your best to kill two bosses ASAP and you can win the game.
